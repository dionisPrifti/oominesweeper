Hey Guys, welcome to my 'OO Minesweeper', Part 3 - Initial Class Design

Let's jump to Eclipse and try to design our classes with the information we have so far.

During our course we will modify our classes by applying OO principles and best practices,
so at the beginning, for some of you the code may seem a little awkward. That is because I 
would like to give also some common mistakes and then learn how to avoid them, after having
understood why it is a bad design in the first place.

Ok, we know that we have a board containing square cells, which are first hidden and then
reveal a mine, a digit or blank.

So, our first class could simply be a cell, containing the digit. We may have a small
agreement here, regarding the value of the digits. Let's say we assume a blank cell to have 
a digit 0, and a mine to have a digit -1. For a "real" digit then, the values would be 1-8.
8 is the maximal number of the adjacent cells of the center of a 3x3 grid.
We also have some special cases here for the corners of the grid, but that would be a separate
video.

Ok, then we have the Board class, which has the dimensions as WIDTH/HEIGHT (ROWS/COLUMNS)
and an array of Cells of these dimensions.

We also have some default code for our Main JavaFX class, so let's run our application and make sure everything is correct.

Ok, I think these three small classes are enough for now.

Next, we'll build a simple GUI in Java FX for the board and then see how to generate a new game.
