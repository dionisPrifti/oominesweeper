Hey Guys, welcome to my 'OO Minesweeper', Part 21 - Game Won

Congratulations, you made it so far! Now finally we will have a game won.
Different minesweeper versions have different rules to end the game.
For example in some of them, if there is only one hidden cell and only one mine left, the game 
will automatically flag that hidden cell as a mine and finish the game.
In some others, if you reach the numbers of flags equal to the total mines, the game reveals all the
hidden cells and then it might be a game win or game over.

Our rule will be simpler and safer:

Game Won! -> When all digits and blanks are revealed and all the mines are flagged.

So, no auto-revealing or auto-flagging.

Ok, now we need a method to implement this logic.

... (Add the checkIfGameWon() method.)

Now, we have to keep a Boolean Property in the Main class, similar to the game Over property.
And then change the labels and the face icon accordingly.

... (Add the gameWonProperty and its listener in the Main class.)

A last step is to check if the game is actually finished and won on each new cell revealed and on each cell flagged.
We should check on both of them because the game can finish either by revealing hidden cells or by setting a flag on the last cell.

... (Check if game won on each new cell revealed.)
... (Check if game won on each cell flagged.)

Let's play a simple game and check what we've done.

Okay now, that seems pretty cool! Congratulations, you just created your own version of Minesweeper!

In the next videos, I will just talk a little about possible improvements and finish our amazing app!

See you there!
