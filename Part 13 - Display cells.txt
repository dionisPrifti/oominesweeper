Hey Guys, welcome to my 'OO Minesweeper', Part 13 - Display Cells

In this video we will display the revealead cells, depending on their value being a digit, blank or a mine.

We already have the displayCell() method in the Cell class. We will expand it by display a mine, blank or a digit.
For the mine, we will use the mine digit we have in our Gui so far. For a blank, we will just put two spaces on the button text.
For the digit, we will display the number as button text and for its color I will use the same colors as in the windows version.
For this, I will introduce a new util class called StyleUtil which will return the color for each digit.

... (Add the dispalyCell() methods. Introduce the StyleUtil class.)

To test this quickly, we can add a test method to reveal all the cells after the first click.

... (Add the revealCells() test method.)

That was it, I think it looks pretty cool so far. Good job guys!

A last think we can add in this video is disabling the cell after first clicking on it.
You know, in minesweeper when a cell is revealed, it can't go back to the hidden state. That's what we will do now.
Java Fx seems to have a little bug here, as sometimes it renders the blank cells without padding, so we will make sure
it will always be okay, by setting the min width and height.

... (Disable a cell after revealing it.)

So, I think that would be enough for this video.

See you on the next video, where we will talk about the playing behaviours.
