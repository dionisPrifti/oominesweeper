Hey Guys, welcome to my 'OO Minesweeper', Part 19 - Indicating neighbours 2, JavaFX concurrent Task

We will continue directly implementing the methods we talked about in the last video.
Go back and recheck the end of the last video in case you don't remember them.

So the first one is a method to Get the number of flagged neighbors of a cell. The logic is pretty easy: we will
check all the neighbours and increment the number of those that are flagged. We will add all the methods in the BoardUtil class.

... (Add numberOfFlaggedNeighbors() method in BoardUtil.)


Ok, the next method will allow us to reveal all the neighbors of a cell. This will be used when clicking on a revealed cell
that has already a number of flagged neighbours equal or greater than its value.

... (Add autoRevealNeighbors() in BoardUtil.)

The last method about indication all the hidden neighbours with a small animation is a little tricky. 
We have to introduce here a task from Java FX concurrent package.

... (Add indicateNeighbors() method with a small animation, using JavaFX concurrent Task.) and explain...

Now, let's call this method on the left mouse click event after a cell is revealed.

... (Add indicating neighbours methods on the left mouse click event on a revealed cell.)

Ok, I think we have a lot of progress done. Now, remains to display Game Over or Game Won and some little details.

See you on the next video where we will start with the Game Over functionality.
