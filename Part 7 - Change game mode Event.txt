Hey Guys, welcome to my 'OO Minesweeper', Part 6 - Change game mode Event

On the previous video we wrote the GameMode enum.
Now, let's use this enum to change the game mode on the game.
For this we need the click event on New Game button.

There are different ways how to set events on Java FX, but we will use the java 8 lambda expression.

...(Add a syso on onAction event fo the button, to test it.)

Now, we can understand that when we create a new game, a couple of things should change:
First, the window width and height.
Second, the flags number should be reset to 0 and the total mines number should be shown, according to the selected
game mode.
Finally, the TilePane should be repopuplate with new toggle buttons.

To do this, initially we need a populateTilePane method which popuplates it by the selected game mode.

Let's declare the TilePane as a member variable of the Main class, so that we can access it everywhere we need.
We will later use it differently.

Now, let's write the populate method and clean up unnecessary code.

...(Add TilePane as a member variable. Write populateTilePane method.)

Now, let's deal with the click event of the New Game Button.
We need here a thread which runs and updates the values on the stage, according to the new
game mode selected. For this scenario we have the concurrent.Task from JavaFx, which has a call() method
that allows us to update the value. This value is than observed and listened and used accordingly.

This all may seem a little complicated at the beginning, so let's write it together.

...(Finished the click event for the New Game Button.)

That was it for this video. Before continuing to the next one, please make sure you understand the basic events and 
listeners in Java FX.
