Hey Guys, welcome to my 'OO Minesweeper', Part 12 - Game Generation 4, Random Mines

Finally, we will generate the board and place the mines randomly. 

Let's go ahead, write the algorithm and explain it along the way. As we explained earlier, this will be a safe version of Minesweeper,
meaning the first cell revealed is guaranteed to be blank. For that reason, the board generation will happen after we click on the first
cell. We'll have a generateBoard() method in the board class, which will take as parameters the first cell clicked.

First we'll add the totalMines member and its getter method on the Board class. 

... (Add totalMines and its gettor on the Board class.)

Now, the logic for the board generation is simple. 
First, we will place the mines randomly making sure that they are not in the the start cell or in its adjacent cells.
Second, we will place the numbers indicating the mines in the adjacent cells. The rest will be blank by default.

... (Add generateBoard(firstCell) method.)

We have also to set the -1 value to the cells, so we will add the setters methods also on the Cell class.

... (Add the small fix to add the value to the cells, when mines are generated and when number are calculated - 2 fix commits)

Ok, that was it. Now let's test it. Upon the first click, we need to create a new Board object and call the generateBoard() method.
To create the Board object we should add a constructor which takes as parameters the gameMode and the firstCell clicked.

... (Add the constructor on the Board class and generate the board upon the first click.)

We will test it by adding a printBoard() method on the BoardUtil class, which will print the generated board.

... (Add the printBoard() on the BoardUtil and call it after generating the baord.)

Ok, let's have some new games and see that it is finally working.

... (Create some new games and check the printed board on the console.)

So, we generated the board finally. I would say we are like half-way done.
See you on the next video, where we will display the cells.
