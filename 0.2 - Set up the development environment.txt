Hey Guys, welcome to my 'OO Minesweeper', Intro - Set up development environment

In this tutorial I'll give a brief overview on how to setup up the development environment with eclipse and Java FX.
This tutorial series is not for complete beginners, so I am assuming you already have them installed, so I am not getting into too
much details.

1. First, download the java development kit, if you don't have that already.
You can either download the open source Open JDK from this link (https://openjdk.java.net/), which is also in the description below,
or Java SE Development Kit 8 from (https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html), also in the
description. Then you have to install them and have the PATH in the system environment variables.

Then go ahead and download Eclipse from the official site. You can choose the right package for your computer, we just need the 
Eclipse for Java developers here (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/). Feel free to download the latest version, there
should be no difference for our tutorial. Just so you know, I am using Eclipse for Java Developers 2018-09.

So, the last piece we need is Java FX. We will use Maven and Git in this tutorial series, so at any time you can check out the code
and hopefully be able to run it directly in your pc. But we need the JavaFX runtime in order to run it locally.

After downloading and installing eclipse, go to Help -> install new software, choose All available sites and search for:
e(fx)clipse. Select and install the found package. If you encounter any problem in this section, go over here 
(https://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html) and check the documentation.

Wait for the installation to finish, you can track the progress in the footer, then restart eclipse and we are ready to go.

In the next tutorial we will continue with creating our Java FX project with Maven and Git.
