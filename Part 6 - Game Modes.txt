Hey Guys, welcome to my 'OO Minesweeper', Part 6 - Game Modes

Ok, in this video we will explain the game modes or difficulty and display the grid accordingly.

In the classic Windows version, there are three modes:

Easy, which has a 9 by 9 grid and 10 total mines.
Medium, which has a 16 by 16 grid and 40 total mines.
and
Hard, which has a 16 by 30 grid with a total of 99 mines.

Let's write these as a Java Enum, called GameMode.

Java Enums can also have fields, and we will use this feature to have the information about
the width/height and the number of mines for each enum value.

... (Write the GameMode enum.)

This is way better and cleaner than using constants for each of this fields.

Now, we can modify the gameDifficultyCombo to use the values from the enum, not just Strings.
And let's call it gameModeCombo.

... (Rename gameDifficultyCombo into gameModeCombo. Using GameMode enum values for it.)

A last thing to mention is that the Window of our minesweeper will be fixed, as it doesn't make sense for the user
to resize it. So, we can have two other properties on the Enum, windowWidth and windowHeight.
I have already calculated the best values for each mode, so just copy and paste them.

... (Added the windowWidth and windowHeight fields on each game mdoe.)

Let's finally use these values for the window size and make it not-resizeable.

... (Set the window size from the GameMode field values and make it not-resizeable.)

That's it for this video, on the next one we will write the game changing event and we are almost done with
the Gui part.
