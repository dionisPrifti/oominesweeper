Hey Guys, welcome to my 'OO Minesweeper', Part 5 - Designing Gui elements

Ok, in this video we will try to align the Gui elements.

First, we can see that the images dispalyed are too big, let's make them the same height as the controls.
We can change the dimensions by using setFitHeight and setFitWidth.

... (Set the imageView Height and Width.)

Now, if we try to build a 9 by 9 grid, we woud see that the control panel is still too big. So, let's have the 
controls on top and under them the icons showing the game status.

... (Do the 9x9 grid, then change the controls into two rows.)
... (Add the padding with Insets - 5,5,5,5)
... (Add regions to align the status icons: left, center, right)
... (Set the font size for the labels)
... (Set the min width and margin for gameDifficultyCombo. Make Easy the default selection.)
... (Set the icon and title for the application.)

So, that's it for this part.
In the next video we will focus on the game modes.
