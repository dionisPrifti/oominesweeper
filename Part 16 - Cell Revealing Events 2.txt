Hey Guys, welcome to my 'OO Minesweeper', Part 16 - Cell Revealing Events 2

In the last video we started implementing the Cell revealing events and did a little refactoring on the Board and BoardUtil classes.

Let's now continue on the Cell class for the revealing events.

For the moment after generating the game, we display all the cells, to test the game generation and the look of the displayed cells.
We should remove the call of the displayCell() method on the revealed flag setter and the test method revealCells() on the Board class.

... (Remove the testing methods to initially reveal all the cells.)

Now we should modify the displayCell() method by setting there the revealed flag and making sure that the cell
can not be set back to the hidden state, once it is revealed.
Let's rename this method displaySingleCell() as we may have other methods in the future that reveal a set of cells.

... (Modified the displayCell() method.)

Now, what we need is a method in the BoardUtil that reveals all the neighbours of a blank cell up to the digits.
Careful with this method, you may get easily confused with the recursive call.

... (Add the revealNeighbors() method in BoardUtil to reveal the neighbours of a blank cell resursively.)

As a last step, we should call the method we just introduced from the cell class. And then this method will be called
from the mouse click event of the cell in the Main class.
Let's do that and check the modifications we need to make in the Main class.

... (Modify the mouse click event on a cell in the Main class.)

OK, that was it. If that seems like too much, you may want to recheck the last two videos, because in fact this was
the trickiest part of our application. After that we should just pay attention to the details, but I would say the 
hardest part is over.

See you in the next video!
