Hey Guys, welcome to my 'OO Minesweeper', Part 2 - Understanding Minesweeper game logic

So, before we jump into coding, let's check first the Minesweeper game logic.

Minesweeper is a single-player board game. The grid consists of hidden squares, which can be 
a mine, a digit or just blank.
The player has to reveal the squares by clicking on them. If a square containing a mine is revealed, 
the game is over. A digit represents the number of all adjacent mines to that cell.
If we click on a square which has no mines adjacent, the square becomes blank, and all adjacent squares 
will be recursively revealed. 

The player uses the information from the digits to find out the mines, marking them with a flag.
The game is won by correctly finding all the mines in the board.

This is, of course, just the overview of the game, we will dig deeper on each scenario and write our code
accordingly. If you have never played minesweeper, definitely google it and play it before starting creating
your own version in Java.

Let's play it together for a while to get used to it... (play a game or two for 2-3 minutes)

So, this was basically it. 
On the next videos we'll go back and forth to the game rules and design our Java classes accordingly.

Before continuing to the next video, have some fun playing Minesweeper while thinking how to program it yourself.
